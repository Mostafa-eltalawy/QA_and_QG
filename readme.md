# Question Generation and Question Answering Data Sets

The following is an inventory of data sets around the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains of Natural Language Generation (NLG)/ Question Generation (QG) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU)/ Question Answering (QA). The motivation to include QA into this repository is simply that often the two occur together. If a corpus is mentioned with a dash ('-') then it is not strictly a QG/NLG or QA/NLU corpus but has been mentioned in a related publication.
